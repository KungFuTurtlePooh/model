# Description
Hello, this is the git repository for my ICP2 Final Project.  My final project is a tensorflow image classifier using a combination of tensorflow.py and tensorflow.js.  The main.py file is the file which trains a tensorflow model and saves it as a .h5 file.  I converted the .h5 model into a .JSON file using "tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=keras /tmp/model.h5 /tmp/tfjs_model" in anaconda prompt.  The .html and .css files are the files that creates the website which allows the user to interact with the trained model.  Thank you for taking the time to teach our class and help us learn how to program.
