# model
Just a high school project

# Description
Hello, this is my final Project for Intro to Computer Science 2. This repository has a fair amount of files, but here is a rundown. All the BIN files and the JSON file is the
model that actually predicts stuff. Then, you have the main.py file which is the file that created the model. Finally, we have the html and CSS file which is the website
portion of the project. I hope you enjoy!
